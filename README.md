# Spacialist Plugin Template

This template is meant as a starting point for Plugin Development. It is setup to work out of the box with spacialist and has a lot of developer tooling already setup, so that you don't have to setup anything on your own and you can start developing right away.

## Setup for Development

To setup the plugin to be ready for development follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository into the spacialist plugin folder `app/Plugins`
2. Install node modules `npm install`
2. Run the setup script `node dev.mjs` **Note using windows you must open the shell as administrator**
2. Run spacialist and the plugin. Most easily done by running the 'dev' task from vscode.
2. Enable plugin in spacialist.
2. Develop!
